                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving various tasks. However, as the world is constantly changing and new information is being generated every day, the trained LLM can be quickly outdated without re-training, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Consequently, maintaining LLMs up-to-date status is a pressing concern in the current era. In this talk, I will provide a review of recent advances in aligning LLMs with the ever-changing world knowledge without re-training from scratch, by categorizing research works and providing in-depth comparisons and discussion. I will also discuss existing challenges and highlight future directions to facilitate research in this field.

                              Large language models have generated a lot of excitement in the community and have delivered many successes. They have also raised many research challenges in terms of their accuracy, efficiency, reliability, safety and applicability. In this talk, I will address some of these challenges for closed-domain search and recommendation applications. I will discuss how such applications can be reformulated as classification tasks by treating each item to be ranked or recommended as a separate label in a multi-label classification framework. This reformulation allows us to leverage solutions based on extreme classification where the objective is to tackle classification problems with millions to billions of categories/labels. I will demonstrate how to combine extreme classifiers with language models to develop accurate search and recommendation systems with low training and inference costs that can benefit many people worldwide.

                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              Combinatorial optimisation technology has come a long way. We now have mature high-level modelling languages in which to specify a model of the particular problem of interest; robust complete solvers in each major constraint paradigm including Constraint Programming (CP), MaxSAT, and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP); effective incomplete search techniques that can easily be combined with complete solvers to speed up the search such as Large Neighbourhood Search; and enough general knowledge about modelling techniques to understand the need for our models to incorporate components such as global constraints, symmetry constraints, and more. All this has significantly reduced the amount of knowledge required to apply this technology successfully to the many different combinatorial optimisation problems that permeate our society.  <br/> <br/>

                              And yet, not many organisations use such advanced optimisation technology; instead, they often rely on the solutions provided by problem-specific algorithms that are implemented in traditional imperative languages and lack any of the above advances. Further, while advanced combinatorial optimisation technology is particularly suitable for the kind of complex human-in-the-loop decision-making problems that occur in critical sectors of our society, including health, transport, energy, disaster management, environment and finance, these decisions are often still made by people with little or no technological support. In this talk I argue that to change this state of affairs, our research focus needs to change from improving the technology on its own, to improving it so that users can better trust, use, and maintain the systems we develop with it.

                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              Since the 1990s, evolutionary computation techniques have been widely used to solve machine learning tasks. In this talk, I will firstly provide a brief overview of machine learning and evolutionary computation, then provide a narrow view and a broad view of evolutionary machine learning.  After discussing the state-of-the-art research and applications of the main paradigms of evolutionary machine learning and their success in classification, feature selection, regression, clustering, computer vision and image analysis, scheduling and combinatorial optimisation, and evolutionary deep learning, the main challenges and lessons will be discussed. If time allows, I will provide an overview of our recent developments and discuss potential opportunities.

                              <b>Abstract:</b>
                              Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology, revolutionizing industries across the world. With its ability to process vast amounts of data, learn from patterns, and make informed decisions, AI is enabling unprecedented levels of automation, efficiency, and innovation. As we stand at the precipice of a technological revolution, it is paramount to explore the immense potential and industry applications of AI, ensuring a balanced perspective that both inspires and informs. <br><br>

                              This presentation will explore the diverse applications of AI across industries such as healthcare, agriculture, environment, and more. We will delve into specific use cases, showcasing how AI is enhancing decision-making processes, augmenting human capabilities, and optimizing operational efficiency across diverse sectors. Additionally, we will discuss the ethical considerations surrounding AI, ensuring that this powerful technology is developed and deployed responsibly. <br><br>

                              This keynote speech aims to ignite a forward-thinking conversation wherein attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of AI's industry applications, exploring ways to harness its potential while addressing the challenges lying ahead. Join us as we uncover the potential of AI and explore how AI can shape the future of industries and drive sustainable growth in the ever-evolving landscape of technological innovation.
